# Technical Diagrams

This repository contains technical diagrams for various technical topics. 

The diagrams are originally created with the desktop version of Draw.io.
There is also a .vsdx file available in case you want to use Visio.


You can get the free and open-source version of Draw.io [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drawio-desktop/pebppomjfocnoigkeepgbmcifnnlndla?hl=en-GB) or [here](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop).
